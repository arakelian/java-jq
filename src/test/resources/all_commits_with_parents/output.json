The reason is that in order to handle backtracking (empty)\nfrom the state update expression, we have to retain a reference to the\nreduction state value in order to restore it upon backtracking.\nRetaining a reference to the reduction state kills performance by\ncausing lots of additional memory allocations and garbage because the\ninput to the update expression will always have at least two references,\nthus no changes to it can be done in-place, and all changes end up being\nCoW changes.\n\nAvoiding this is the very reason for the LOADVN instruction (leaving\n`null` in the variable loaded from).",
